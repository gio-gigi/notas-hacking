I FIND THAT THE DISTRICT HE NAMED IS IN THE EXTREME EAST OF THE COUNTRY, JUST ON THE BORDERS OF THREE STATES, TRANSYLVANIA, MOLDAVIA AND BUKOVINA, IN THE MIDST OF THE CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS; ONE OF THE WILDEST AND LEAST KNOWN PORTIONS OF EUROPE. I WAS NOT ABLE TO LIGHT ON ANY MAP OR WORK GIVING THE EXACT LOCALITY OF THE CASTLE DRACULA, AS THERE ARE NO MAPS OF THIS COUNTRY AS YET TO COMPARE WITH OUR OWN ORDNANCE SURVEY MAPS;
